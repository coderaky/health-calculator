# HEALTH Calculator ðŸ’ª

This application is useful to have a quick peek on your health, it gives an overview of whether you are becoming overweight, underweight, or you are normal.
It takes the input of your height, weight, and age. This is further used to calculate your BMI (Body Mass Index) which in turn used in calculating your health.
It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling. <br><br>
